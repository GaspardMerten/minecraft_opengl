Welcome to the minecraft opengl project! This exciting endeavour is a simple implementation of Minecraft using OpenGL. The project is primarily written in C++, with some GLSL.

## About This Project ðŸŽ®

Minecraft OpenGL is a simplified version of Minecraft, focusing on core Minecraft features and game mechanics. It includes:

- A procedurally generated 3D world just like in Minecraft.
- Basic player interactions similar to those in Minecraft, including mining and building.
- Non-player characters (NPCs) that animate and interact with the environment.
- Basic water physics, including reflection and refraction.
- Dynamic shadows that move and adapt based on the light source.

While this project does not aim to replicate all the features of Minecraft, it seeks to provide a simple, yet immersive, 3D sandbox experience for those interested in game development, particularly with OpenGL and C++.
